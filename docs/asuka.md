# Asuka

## Basic Oki

### Enders for basic Oki
- `df+3 `
- `ff+2,3`
- `ff+2,1`

### Basic Oki options

- `db3`
- `3+4`

Simple mix with these two options, both hit grounded and leave you safe, one mid one low, better options available but these are alright and simple

If expecting a wake up attack bait it and whiff punish

`3+4` will crush wake up low kicks and give a guaranteed `f+2` afterwards

### Golden Oki
 
This involves:
- `wr+1+2`
- `sprint > 3`
- `dash > f+3+4`

If they get up then they have to block the standing 3 or wr+1+2, this will give you some nice plus frames to work with

If they stay on the ground `f+3+4` will hit them and give us Naniwa Gusto if we don't already have it, dash is used to track siderolls

Quick recovery when in FUFT will beat this, but if using the enders `df+3` and `ff+2+3` as they can't use this recovery, whiff punish this.

`wr+1+2` and `3` is your 50:50 between ducking and not ducking it 

`wr+1+2` is plus on block and chips if they don't duck

`3` is mid, will hit if they duck, hit confirmable into `3,1` which will do good damage and give you plus frames. `3` on itself is safe. `3,1` extension can give you mental frames as well as it's super rewarding on CH so a lot of people will be unwilling to press into it.

### Power Mixup

If you know they're going to tech and respect you approach and apply your power mixup which is 

- `1+2` as your launching mid
- `ff+1` as your power mid with good plus frames
- `d+1+2` as your power low

### Wakeup kicks

Just stand back and wait, launch punish on whiff, other options will interrupt but the full launch punish is obviously the best option. React to the animation not the whiff for springkicks!

### Backroll catch

After `ff+2,3` or `df+3` ender if the opponent does a back quick roll you can back roll catch them  as they're in FDFA so we can get a full relaunch with a well timed sprint `f+2` or `wr+1+2`

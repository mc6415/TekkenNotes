## Gameplan

Get close and personal. Always aim to be plus on frames utilising things such
as sidestep cancelling, get the opponent to press buttons and just overwhelm
the opponent with pressure.

## Approaching Moves

| Move       | Speed | Block | Hit | CH   |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | --- | ---- |
| `f+4`      | i21   | -5    | +5  |      |
| `CD.3`     | i19   | -20   | +0  | +21a |
| `uf+4,3,4` |       | -9    | -1  |      |
| `df+3,2`   |       | +1    | +5  | +12  |
|            |       |       |     |      |

::: details

`f+4`
~ Has an extension with `f+4,2` which is a hit confirmable heat engager  
Can sidestep off of `f+4` which will leave you +2 on block see
[Sidestepping Options](#sidestep-options) for more information on that
people will tend to be ducking though for the `f+4,2` so can try a `SS.2`
launch or a throw

`CD.3`
~ Main value here is long range, goes under highs and CH launches

`uf+4,3,4`
~ If low hits last hit will always hit, also called Can Opener

## Keepout Moves

| Move     | Speed | Block | Hit  | CH  |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | --- |
| `f+1+2`  | i17   | -14   | +11a |     |
| `b+1+4`  | i15   | -15   | +34a |     |
| `db+3+4` | i18   | -17   | +36  |     |

::: details

`f+1+2`
~ Very good armour move that heat engages on hit

`b+1+4`
~ 15f Launcher

`db+3+4`
~ Good range, good for whiff punishing

## Up Close Moves

| Move        | Speed | Block | Hit  | CH   |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| `1,2`       |       | -1    | +5   |      |
| `b+2,2,2`   |       | -9    | +9   | +45a |
| `df+1,2`    |       | -3    | +2   | +9   |
| `1+4`       | i15   | -5    | +4c  | +6c  |
| `df+2`      | i15   | -7    | +34a |      |
| `d+3,4,3`   |       | -7    | +22a |      |
| `d,df+4`    | i20   | -37   | +14a | +27a |
| `db+3`      | i20   | -13   | +4c  | +13a |
| `d+2,2`     |       | -12   | +17a | +71a |

::: details

`1,2`
~ Fastest move, use to contest people pushing on your plus frames, e.g. after
heat burst

`b+2,2,2`
~ Triple high so can be punished with a low, homing so good option against a
player who likes to sidestep to keep them in check, counter hit launches on the
last hit

`df+1,2`
~ Use this other 1,2 if you don't need the speed

`d+3,4,3`
~ Great low, amazing at the wall as it wall splats, can toss it out when minus
to beat high moves but obviously be cautious doing so

`d+2,2`
~ Great utility, can play some mind games with it, if the opponent keeps
blocking the second hit you can hold `d` to stay crouched and sweep or go into
a throw

`f,f,f+1+2`
~ Heat engager
